## Project Status: In Progress

> Backend development is currently **in progress** (~90 hours logged so far).  
> Auth system, organization-specific task/project APIs, and role-based access are functional.

You can track my development log here: [working_hours.md](./working_hours.md)

- Organizations: data isolation per company
- Project creation APIs
- Task creation routes

## üìå Why I Built This

I'm building TaskTracker as a **real-world, production-style web project** to:

- Deepen my understanding of full-stack development
- Practice clean API design and scalable backend patterns
- Simulate company-like development (tickets, role-based control, etc.)
- Showcase a complete project to potential employers and recruiters
