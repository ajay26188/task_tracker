## 📌 Why I Built This

I'm building TaskTracker as a **real-world, production-style web project** to:

- Deepen my understanding of full-stack development
- Practice clean API design and scalable backend patterns
- Simulate company-like development (tickets, role-based control, etc.)
- Showcase a complete project to potential employers and recruiters
